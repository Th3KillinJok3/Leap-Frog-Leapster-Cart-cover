# Leap-Frog-Leapster-Cart-cover
A cover for the Cartridge port of Leapster GS console.

This file is experimental cover designed to mimic the real cartridge.
For best FDM print - print with PETG standing upright.
This is a really early concept, but as is stands it can be usable with a tad of fiddling.

PCB that goes along with it to be found here:
